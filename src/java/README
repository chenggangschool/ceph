libcephfs Java wrappers
=======================

- native/: C++
- java/: Java
- test/: JUnit tests
- lib/: JUnit library
- build.xml: Test runner

Building
--------

Autotools handles the build using the configure flag --enable-cephfs-java

Testing
-------

These tests assume a live cluster, and depend on JUnit and Ant.

To run the tests make sure that the JUnit JAR is available in the lib/
directory. For example:

  $ mkdir lib
  $ cd lib
  $ curl -O https://github.com/downloads/KentBeck/junit/junit-4.8.2.jar

Ant is used to run the unit test (apt-get install ant). For example:

  $ cd src/
  $ ./vstart -d -n --localhost
  $ cd java
  $ CEPHFS_CONF=../ceph.conf ant test

1. The tests depend on the compiled wrappers. If the wrappers are installed as
part of a package (e.g. Debian package) then this should 'just work'. Ant will
also look in the current directory for 'libcephfs.jar' and in ../.libs for the
JNI library.  If all else fails, set the environment variables CEPHFS_JAR, and
CEPHFS_JNI_LIB accordingly.

2. Set CEPHFS_CONF environment variable to point to a ceph.conf. This can be
omitted if the desired configuration file can be found in a default location.

Documentation
-------------

Ant is used to build the Javadocs:

  $ ant docs
